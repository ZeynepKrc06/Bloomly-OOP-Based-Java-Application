Bloomly

Bloomly is a console-based Java application that focuses on applying core Object-Oriented Programming concepts in a structured and practical way. This project was designed to model a small system using Java classes and object-oriented principles.  
It emphasizes clean structure, logical class relationships, and readable code rather than complexity. 

The project simulates a simple flower shop management system. Users can add, remove, update, and list flowers, manage customers, and create or track orders through a menu-driven console interface.
